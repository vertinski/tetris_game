tetris_game.py is a Tetris Game code produced by prompting the OpenAI Codex engine. I have not modified the generated code. Also, there was a graphic glitch while clearing the bottom line. 
Codex is an AI system that translates natural language to code. In this case it's Python code.
The prompt is a text snippet that is fed to the Codex engine for completion. Completed text is a program code or script, etc.

**The prompt**
>#Define a python function which is a very compact tetris game.\
>#Display playing field using pygame library.
>
>import pygame
  
  
**Prompt parameters**
>Temperature: 0.7\
>Top P: 1\
>Frequency penalty: 0\
>Presence penalty: 0\
>Best of: 1

(Response length can be adjusted as needed)

Gameplay:
Use arrow buttons to navigate the shapes. Stack shapes flawlessly to clear more lines.
